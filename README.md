üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

The Hospital Patient Monitoring Scheduler employs a sophisticated multi-layered architecture that demonstrates enterprise-grade software design principles while maintaining optimal performance for real-time medical applications. The system is built around a modular, event-driven architecture that separates concerns across four primary layers, each responsible for distinct aspects of the patient monitoring pipeline.
The Patient Management Layer forms the foundation of the system, centered around the Patient class which encapsulates individual patient data, medical history, and dynamic risk assessment capabilities. This layer maintains sliding windows of vital sign readings for efficient trend analysis while implementing personalized normal ranges based on patient demographics and medical history. Each patient object manages its own memory footprint through intelligent data retention policies, keeping only the most recent 100 readings per vital sign type to balance historical context with memory efficiency.

The Device Simulation Layer provides realistic medical equipment behavior through the MedicalDevice class, which generates authentic vital sign patterns with configurable noise injection and anomaly simulation. This layer supports multiple device types including heart rate monitors, blood pressure cuffs, pulse oximeters, and temperature sensors, each with medically accurate baseline values and realistic variation patterns. The simulation engine can inject controlled abnormalities to test emergency response scenarios, making it invaluable for system validation and training purposes.

The Alert Processing Engine implements the core intelligence of the system through the AlertProcessor class, which utilizes priority queue-based scheduling algorithms to handle concurrent alert streams with microsecond precision timing. This engine processes thousands of alerts per second while maintaining strict response time guarantees based on medical criticality levels. The processor incorporates comprehensive logging and performance metrics collection, enabling real-time system health monitoring and optimization.

The Scheduler Core orchestrates system-wide operations through the HospitalScheduler class, managing device-patient assignments, load balancing, and coordination between monitoring, processing, and alerting subsystems. This central component implements resource allocation strategies that ensure optimal system utilization while preventing resource contention that could impact critical alert processing times.

üèóÔ∏è Operating Systems Concepts Implemented

The Hospital Patient Monitoring Scheduler serves as a comprehensive demonstration of fundamental operating systems principles, seamlessly integrating theoretical concepts with practical healthcare applications. The system's CPU scheduling implementation centers around a sophisticated multi-level priority queue architecture that mirrors real-world operating system schedulers, with four distinct priority levels each carrying specific response time guarantees ranging from sub-2-second critical alerts to 60-minute routine notifications. The scheduler employs preemptive priority scheduling with intelligent starvation prevention mechanisms, ensuring that lower-priority tasks eventually receive processing time while maintaining strict guarantees for life-critical alerts. Round-robin scheduling is applied within priority levels to ensure fairness among alerts of equal importance, while deadline-aware processing algorithms monitor and enforce response time requirements across all system components.

The memory management subsystem demonstrates advanced techniques including smart pointer usage (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) for automatic resource cleanup and prevention of memory leaks, which is critical in medical systems that must maintain 24/7 operation. The system implements circular buffer data structures for efficient historical data storage, providing O(1) insertion and bounded memory usage regardless of system runtime. Memory pool allocation strategies optimize high-frequency vital sign data processing, while per-patient memory limits prevent any single patient from consuming excessive system resources. The architecture includes automatic garbage collection of expired data and intelligent memory compaction during low-activity periods.

Synchronization and concurrency management throughout the system employs thread-safe data structures and atomic operations to handle concurrent access patterns without sacrificing performance. The producer-consumer pattern is implemented for device data streaming, allowing medical devices to generate readings independently while ensuring proper ordering and processing in the alert pipeline. Lock-free algorithms are utilized in performance-critical paths to minimize latency, while careful use of mutexes and condition variables provides data integrity guarantees where atomic operations are insufficient. The system demonstrates advanced concepts such as priority inheritance and deadlock avoidance, ensuring that high-priority medical alerts are never delayed by lower-priority system operations.
